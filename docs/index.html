  <h1>Hello. I'm Jeremy.</h1>

  <p>Maybe you're here because you met me at a party. Or we met through work. Or you're one of my students. Or one of my teachers. Or maybe you're intrigued by my rakish, smoldering, yet undefinable charm. Whatever it is, I have what you need here.</p>

  <p>Here are the short fiction works I'm most proud of. Please leave me a nice note if you enjoyed one of them. Please?</p>

  <p>Here are the web apps, design projects, and techy-related stuff I've been working on.</p>

  <p>Here are the video games I worked as a writer on.</p>

  <p>Here's my LinkedIn and here's my Twitter.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to send me an email, you can do so right here.</p>
